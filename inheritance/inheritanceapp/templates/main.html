     <!-- This code is a script tag that loads the Popper.js library from npm, which is an open source JavaScript framework for creating interactive experiences with HTML5 and CSS3. The code then creates a new instance of the popper object using its constructor function, passing in two parameters: window and document. This allows us to use this object anywhere within our page without having to worry about where we're calling it from or what context it's being used in. Next, we create an event listener on our document so that when any element on our page is clicked, we can call the close method on our popper object and stop listening for events related to this particular element. -->

     <!-- This code starts with a <script> tag that includes the bootstrap.min.js file. Next, there are two attributes: crossorigin="anonymous" and type="text/javascript". Crossorigin tells the browser that this script can be loaded from any origin (the same as anonymous.)Type tells the browser what kind of content this script is; in this case, text/javascript indicates that it's a JavaScript programing language code for running on a web page or website rather than an external application like Adobe Acrobat Reader or Microsoft Wordpad. It loads the bootstrap library from cdnjs, which in turn includes a javascript file that has the code above. -->
